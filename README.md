math-sign-in
============

An online sign-in sheet for the university Math Center, a drop-in tutoring center. Used there since January 2015. 

Tutors must enter a password to get to the sign-in page for the students.

Students are able to sign in with their student identification number. If not in the system, they enter their class information and are signed in. If already in the system, they are automatically signed in. 

Math department personnel can add and edit the class info (class level, professor, time) each term. They can also see useful aggregations and statistics of the sign-in data, like how many students signed in per week, how many students signed in at different times of the day, or how many students came in for each class level.
